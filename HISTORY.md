# Version 2.0

* Pimsviewer is completely re-written from scratch, it is not backwards compatible
* Performance is improved by using native PyQt canvases for drawing instead of Matplotlib
* A file info dialog is added, displaying most information that PIMS can infer from the file
* The plugin system is revamped and example plugins are added that are enabled by default, with the most notable one an Annotate plugin that can annotate positions saved to a CSV file from Trackpy
